# Blob-Detection
ECE-558 Digital Imaging Systems course project3: For this project  Lowe's SIFT algorithm was used for blob detection on a variety of images
###### This repo contains the code as well as the outputs for the for the Second project from the ECE-558 Digital Imaging Systems course at NC State University. 

The task for this project included:
- Generating Laplacian of Gaussian Filter
- Building Laplacian Scale Space
- Performing Non-Maximum Suppression
- Displaying resulting circles at their characteristic scale
- 
## Dependencies 
This project requires Python 3 along with the following python modules:
- Numpy 
- CV2

## Structure 
The [code](./kddo_dfmunozs_project03/kddo_dfmunoz_code/) for this project is contained in a sigle directory with the following files: 
- [P3_main.py](./kddo_dfmunozs_project03/kddo_dfmunoz_code/P3_main.py) contains the main code

## Outputs
Examples of blobs detected for the images as well as the original images can be seen in the PDF report as well as the [images](./kddo_dfmunozs_project03/kddo_dfmunozs_images) directory of the project


## Runing the code
The code was designed to be run on a Linux system as a python file using the python3 interpreter 

Example run : `python3 P3_main.py`
